# Sand Table

This repository contains the code to run a sand table kinetic sculpture. It includes:

- A web server for interacting with the table
- LED drivers for controlling ambient lighting
- Stepper motor controllers to move the magnet

This is distinct from the other sand-table repository by being implemented entirely on an ESP32. Filenames in the www folder were changed to meet the character limits imposed by the SD Card driver

To build and run this code, the ESP32-IDF must be installed locally on your machine.
